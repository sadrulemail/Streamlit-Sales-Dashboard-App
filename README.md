Building Your Interactive Dashboard: A Step-by-Step Guide to Streamlit in Snowflake
This guide provides a step-by-step process for creating and deploying an interactive Streamlit dashboard directly within your Snowflake environment.

Step 1: The Blueprint (Preparation)
üêç Prepare Python Script
Save your Streamlit application code as a .py file. This script will use Snowpark to securely connect and query data directly within Snowflake.

üìä Prepare Sample Data
Get your dataset ready as a CSV file. This data will be uploaded to Snowflake and loaded into a table for your dashboard to visualize.

Step 2: The Foundation (Snowflake Setup)
Create Stages
Set up two stages: one for your data file (sales_data_stage) and one for your app file (streamlit_app_stage).

Create & Load Table
Define a table for your sales data, then use the COPY INTO command to load the data from your CSV in the stage.

Create Streamlit App
Execute the CREATE STREAMLIT command, pointing to your app's stage and main Python file.

Step 3: The Assembly (File Upload)
‚¨ÜÔ∏è Upload Data File
Navigate to sales_data_stage in the Snowflake UI and upload your sales_data.csv file.

‚¨ÜÔ∏è Upload Application File
Go to streamlit_app_stage and upload your streamlit_snowflake_app.py file.

Step 4: The Launch (Go Live!)
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run Your Application
In the Snowflake UI, click on the Streamlit tab, find your newly created dashboard, and click to launch it. Your interactive dashboard is now live!
